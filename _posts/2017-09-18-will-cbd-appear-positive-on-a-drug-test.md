title: Will CBD Show as Positive on a Drug Test?
---

## First of all you should ask yourself if CBD is illegal or not

Many people share a common dilemma, and it deals with whether their CBD intake will cause some problems when undergoing a drug test, either for their workplace or for other activities which request such tests. It is nothing to judge in this because, as you may already be aware of, high-quality CBD products will also comprise an amount of THC, no matter how low it is. Although it will not bring any of the "high" effects which a higher THC concentration would bring along, it is still questionable whether it will show or not on a drug test. 

So it is all about the amount we administer to the body. So things can be quite simple: you look out for a certain THC amount so that you can peacefully carry on with your CBD treatment. However, doesn’t any THC amount get to appear positive on a drug test, no matter if it is under the legal limit? Several experiments have been carried out which revealed how people should not worry concerning their THC intake showing positive at drug tests. Even though these were made public and people got free access to them, it seems that there is still a strong concern focusing on this matter.

That is why researchers kept on testing it and what they found out in their latest studies is something you need to know about. 

## Radioimmunoassay could detect small THC amounts

It is no flash news that employers are turning to this drug test method of keeping an eye on their people. Demands have increased so much that the working market needs strong and capable individuals who can adequately carry out any given tasks. It is a significant risk to put your work in the hands of a drug user, and that is why such drug tests are more and more used within the working market. 

With this whole technology development, even the methods of analyzing the human blood, to look out for any not welcomed substance within the body, have evolved. One of the newest ways through which any amount of substance can be noticed within somebody’s blood is called [radioimmunoassay](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/164695). It seems that even low quantities of no matter what substances can be traced to it.

The same is valid for THC, and this is the exact information that got CBD users worrying. As any CBD product should contain a small amount of THC, this new method of testing the blood can represent quite the enemy for these working individuals. However, digging deeper into this whole radioimmunoassay testing method, it seems that it can frequently bring forward false positive results. 

## What is the deal with this false results?

As it was mentioned earlier, this blood testing method can have its ups and down, depending on what perspective you choose to see it. On the one hand, it is quite helpful for employers to see whether they have honest and trustful people under their “wing.” On the other hand, it is quite frustrating for people using CBD products, which contain even a slight amount of THC, to come positive on a drug test just for wanting to relieve some health issues.

The fact that false positive results can be revealed with this radioimmunoassay testing method deals with the “tools” used to test either the blood or the urine samples. For instance, depending on the THC amount, results can come out positive, as it was mentioned earlier. It makes all the sense in the world, and nobody can deny this.

However, when blood or urine samples are tested by using other “tools,” such as gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, results come out negative. So what can we understand from all these information? The essential idea to be kept in mind is that anybody can continue with their [CBD treatments](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2828614/), as long as they look out for the THC amount administered to their body, which should be less than 100 mg to 150 mg each day. The chances for the tests to come out positive are very low if these conditions are followed.

## Is there anything else to keep in mind?

Well yes, there is, and those who prefer CBD products instead of other traditional products for relieving pains or solving other health issues should keep on reading. Like any other substance, you choose to give to your body. Also, CBD can interact with other ones. 

It is like a never-ending cycle which is important to be looked at any time any unpleasant symptom is felt. The thing is that once you decide to include high CBD products into your daily habits, you need to fully be aware of the fact that, if you are already undergoing other medication treatments, you should ask for a specialist’s advice on whether a negative interaction could occur or not.

Also, keep in mind that each of us has our way of reacting to substances and each human body has a specific way through which its metabolism works. It is all related to the genetic inheritance which provides specific metabolic processes which the body can work with. This is also valid for the drugs’ metabolism and thus, for the way each body accepts or does not accept the prescribed drugs we offer it. 

Therefore, if you actually wish to keep your job and not let your wise choice of using CBFD products with low THC amounts interfere with this plan, you need to constantly be aware of the things previously mentioned: THC amount and method of testing either blood or urine samples. It 's not hard at all, and once you get a grip on it, you will carry on your stuff much easier.
